# 🚀 OOPs-journey — My Object-Oriented Programming Adventure in C++

Welcome to my OOPs-journey repository!  
This project captures my personal learning path through **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** using C++.  
It contains practice code, examples, and mini-projects that helped me master core OOP concepts through hands-on implementation.

## 📂 Repository Overview

**Name:** OOPs-journey  
**Language:** C++ (100%)  
**Contents:**  
- `classes and objects/`  
- `constructors/`

## 📝 What You’ll Find Inside


- **`classes and objects/`** – Simple examples illustrating how to define and use classes and objects.  
- **`constructors/`** – Demonstrations of constructors and destructors in action.  
- **`inheritance/`** – Code exploring single, multilevel, and hybrid inheritance.  
- **`pointers/`** – Usage of pointers with classes, dynamic memory, and better memory handling.  
- **`polymorphism/`** – Examples of compile-time (function overloading) and runtime (virtual functions) polymorphism.  
- **`abstraction/`** – Demonstrations of abstract classes and pure virtual functions, showing how to hide implementation details and expose only necessary functionality.
